🚀 Overview
A.U.R.A is an agentic automotive intelligence system that transcends traditional dashboards. It thinks, predicts, and acts autonomously—enabling vehicles to understand their environment, protect drivers, and contribute to sustainability goals.
Built with Google Gemini AI, multi-agent orchestration, and a real-time simulation engine, A.U.R.A demonstrates how autonomous ecosystems can fundamentally reshape mobility.

🔱 The Three Pillars of A.U.R.A
1. AURA TATVA — The Mind 🧠
The Intelligence of Truth

Real-time telemetry monitoring (voltage, RPM, temperature)
Predictive diagnostics using ML simulation
Example Scenario: Detects alternator failure risk, predicts timeline, and automatically schedules service appointment

2. AURA JEEVAH — The Heart ❤️
The Pulse of Life

Driver health and wellness monitoring
PERCLOS-based fatigue detection
Example Scenario: Identifies driver fatigue, suggests emergency rest stops, and adjusts cabin settings for comfort

3. AURA PRAVAHA — The Flow 🔄
The Flow of Renewal

Circular economy intelligence
Component lifecycle tracking and material recovery
Example Scenario: Monitors brake pad wear, triggers end-of-life alert, and schedules recycling pickup
